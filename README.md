## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- Project 1:- [Chess Bot](https://github.com/Jinish2170/CHESS-BOT-.git): Chess Bot is a simple AI-powered chess engine developed in Python. It's designed to provide quick responses while playing chess against human opponents or other chess engines. Using AI algorithms such as minimax with alpha-beta pruning and heuristic evaluation functions, Chess Bot offers an enjoyable and challenging gameplay experience for players of all skill levels.

- Project 2:- [Cyber Security AI File Scanner](https://github.com/Jinish2170/Cyber-Security-AI-file-scanner.git): The Cyber Security AI File Scanner is a versatile tool developed to enhance cybersecurity measures by scanning various file types, including PDF, PPT, and TXT, for potential security threats. Powered by artificial intelligence algorithms, this scanner efficiently analyzes files to detect malicious content, suspicious patterns, and vulnerabilities. Its ability to handle different file formats makes it an invaluable asset for organizations and individuals seeking to bolster their defenses against cyber threats. Additionally, the model is trained on a dataset of 20 cybersecurity newsletters, ensuring its effectiveness in identifying emerging threats and trends in the cybersecurity landscape.

- Project 3:- [Web Assistant AI](https://github.com/Jinish2170/Web-Assistant-AI.git): The Web Assistant AI is a simple yet powerful speech recognition system integrated with web search capabilities. This AI assistant enables users to interact with their devices using voice commands, performing web searches, retrieving information, and executing tasks hands-free. Whether you're looking for quick answers, conducting research, or multitasking, the Web Assistant AI streamlines your workflow and enhances your browsing experience with its intuitive voice interface.
